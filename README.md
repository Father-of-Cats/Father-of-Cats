### Hello there, I'm Hunter Nelson ðŸ§—

I work as a Director at a small series of gyms in TX & OK but have been working on building up my webdev skills since Summer of 2021. In my freetime I rock climb and build & play TTRPGs.

## I'm Learning

I am currently working on improving my React skills as I think it's a incredibly useful and fun library. I am about to finish a full-stack bootcamp through SMU and will be spending my summer improving my portfolio to better reflect my skill set and projects I am proud of.
